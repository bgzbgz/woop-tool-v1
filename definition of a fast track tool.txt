Definition of a tool:

The tool is help to utilize acquired information for making decisions .

We give out clients information (the content from the sprints), so we can educate them
Then we tell them - use this information to make a decision
To make a decision , we will help them structure the information they have learned (from the sprint), then we will help them with the thinking structure they need to have in order to make a decision.
Our Fast Track tools are the structure of the required thinking our clients need to have in order for them to make a certain decision.
The tool has to help the client to go through certain steps, so they make a decision.

An example:

We have target segment

Whats the decision that our clients need to make in the end of the sprint:
Whats their target segment
What are the tools?
Market analysis
Attractiveness index
Those tools are the logical steps that Fast Track needs to make the client go through so they client can make a decision.

When the client gets to the tool, the tool has to help the client use the knowledge they have already learned and have been though. The tool comes from the sprint content.

I need to understand two things for each sprint:
The logic
The decision 

If i understand the logic behind a process - i will know the answers behind 99% of the questions

The tool has to meet an 8th point criteria:
Causes you to take a final clear decision - The tool forces a concrete outcome, not just thinking or analysis
No questions needed to be asked when using the tool - Zero confusion, zero need for associate support or clarification
Extremely easy and intuitive slow first steps - Simple entry point that builds confidence immediately
Feedback on each step of good or bad work - Instant validation loops (like credit card fields turning red when wrong)
Exciting gamification in some of the steps - Engagement mechanics that make progress rewarding
Crystal clear visibility of client results - Transparent output that shows exactly what you've created
Mass communication of the decision used - Public commitment mechanism that creates accountability
It smells like Fast Track - Unmistakable brand identity and methodology DNA










Christo Tools Process Broken Down 

What is the decision that a certain sprint tool aims to make 
Please apply all the research I have provided and all the criteria I have developed for the perfect fast track tool and generate guidelines for the perfect tool to reach the decision.

After i have the decision for a tool and the recommendations i can play with ai as much as i want:
How can i implement gamification
Can you decompose the steps in the decision making process of this tool
What is the best way to represent the decision making steps in the tool
What is the information i need to provide so when people go to those substeps (tools), they will not make any mistakes
Investigate until i have a crystal clear idea. And finally I should end up with instructions
After i have everything sorted and everything is cleared out, then ill upload the existing tool
Can you please severely critique the exciting tool and give me advise: Should i improve the existing tool or start from scratch
If ai says it shits:
Ill ask it for best case examples of tools that fulfill a similar job
What is the best platform to create the tool
