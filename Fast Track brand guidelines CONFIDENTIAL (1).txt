Don’t use capitalisation or exclamation marks
for emphasis or to convey energy. If you feel the need
to emphasize a word use a color or bold type.
Stick to a single, active tense:
“We do this” not “We will do this”
Avoid gender-based idioms
e.g. “Separate the men from the boys”
Avoid flowery metaphors, elaborate sentence structures
and complicated language. Metaphors and similes should
clarify and pack a punch.

[INTERNAL USE ONLY]

Never ramble or repeat.

WE don t SPEAK

So we can inspire, motivate and push you

As “yes people" or the opposite:
a distant third party.
In a cold, rude or patronising tone.
With over-excitement or using fluffy clichés.
Like your best friend. We tell you the
truth, not just what you want to hear.
So we can bore you with bookish theory, get
involved in politics, drama or one-upmanship.
For the sake of speaking. What we say matters.

Spell Fast Track as two words.

REWRITE

One in seven people in the world lives in
India – the second biggest country on
the planet. The economy of the country
is still far behind China and a large
part of the population live in extreme
poverty. Two mind boggling facts
could point to an interesting solution:
1. Indian people work on average
2300 hours per year, Germans
work 1350 hours per year
2. German companies on
average are 12 times more
productive than Indian

Indian employees work an average
of 2300 hours per year. German
employees work an average of 1300.

The older generation always
knows better. Or does it?

Age and experience aren’t
the same thing.

Think the Germans are lazy?
Think again.

[INTERNAL USE ONLY]

German companies are 12 times more
productive than their Indian counterparts.
