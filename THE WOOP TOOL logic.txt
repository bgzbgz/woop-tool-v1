The WOOP tool consists of 4 concepts:

Dream creates energy
Clarity of dream creates comfort -> why because the brain doesn't differentiate between if something is in your head or in reality - the human brain feels discomfort if it is going towards something that is unknown
Mental contrasting
Mind rehearsal - for example how Lewis Hamilton rehearsed how he drives each lap before he even steps in the car prior to the race

What the WOOP tool does:

Step 1.
It answers and provides clarity on the following questions:
What is the end game of the task/project?
What have I achieved? What's the concrete outcome?
How has the world changed?
How do I feel about it?

The result of after using the tool should be clarity and energy 

Step 2.
The WOOP tool provides clarity and answer the following questions:
What are the steps I have to go through in order to get to my end game?

The WOOP tool allows you to imagine the steps one by one and you mentally rehearse them, so you know exactly what do and to have brutal clarity on what needs to happen - how and when

Step 3. 
The WOOP tool provides clarity and answers the following questions:

Which are the difficulties that I will face on my way to my endgame 
Then the client lists the problems they think will happen on their way to the end game
They list them
Then they need to ask themselves - what will i do when those problems occur?

The concept is “you need to be mentally prepared, so when the problem or challange comes, you will get happy and excited because you will already have seen this problem! You will be prepared and you will simply say - Nothing new to me.”

Step 4
Fast Track methodology - we hate big steps . Big steps are intimidating. In order for us to break the steps down is to use cut the elephant technique. Once you have the big elephant chopped down, you choose the smallest and easiest part to eat (tackle at work)

The first step should be the easiest.
